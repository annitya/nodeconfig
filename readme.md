NodeConfig Plugin
=================

Installation
------------
    Install as you would any JetBrains-plugin.

Supported products
------------------
    IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, AppCode, CLion, Gogland and Rider.

Know issues
-----------
    It is not possible to provide references for imported config-properties.
    This causes json-properties to be marked as unresolved.    
    Icons for goto-representation for config-attributes disappears.

Roadmap
-------
    Add json-support for find usages/rename refactoring.
    Add replacement-inspection for imported properties.
    Add support for alternate syntax: `config.get('api.basePath');` 
    
    Suggestions?
